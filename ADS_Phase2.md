FUTURE SALES PREDICTION:
Problem:
Explain in detail the complete steps that will be taken by you to put your design that you thought of in previous phase into transformation.
Output:
1.	Data Collection:
•	 Gather historical sales data, including date, product/service, location, price, and other relevant factors.
•	 Collect additional external data that may impact sales, such as economic indicators, seasonality, holidays, and marketing campaigns.

2.	Data Preprocessing:
•	Clean and preprocess the data to handle missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies.
•	Convert categorical variables into numerical format using techniques like one-hot encoding or embeddings.
•	Normalize or scale numerical features to bring them to a common scale.
3.	Feature Engineering:
•	Create new features that might be informative for sales predictions, such as rolling averages, trend indicators, and seasonality features.

4.	Splitting the Data:
•	Divide the dataset into training, validation, and test sets to assess and validate the model's performance accurately.
5.	Model Selection:
•	Choose an appropriate machine learning model for sales prediction. Common choices include:
•	Time series forecasting models (e.g., ARIMA, Exponential Smoothing).
•	Regression models (e.g., Linear Regression, Random Forest).
•	Neural networks (e.g., LSTM, GRU for sequence data).
6.	 Model Training:
•	Train the selected model using the training data.
•	Optimize hyperparameters using techniques like cross-validation and grid search.
7.	Model Evaluation:
•	Evaluate the model's performance using the validation dataset.
•	Use appropriate metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), or Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) to measure accuracy.
8.	Hyperparameter Tuning:
•	Fine-tune the model by adjusting hyperparameters based on validation results.

9.	Model Deployment:
•	Deploy the trained model to a production environment, such as a web application or an API.

10.	Monitoring and Maintenance:
	Continuously monitor the model's performance in a real-world setting.
	Retrain the model periodically to account for changing trends and patterns.
11.	Visualization and Reporting: 
•	Create interactive dashboards or reports to present sales predictions and insights to stakeholders.
