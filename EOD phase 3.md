ADS Projects
Phase 3: Development Part 1
In this phase you will begin building your project. Please refer below the requirements technology
wise:
AI & ADS:
In these two technology projects you will begin building your project by loading and preprocessing
the dataset. Perform different analysis as needed. After performing the relevant activities create a
document around it and share the same for assessment.
DAC:
In this technology projects you will begin building your project by loading and preprocessing the
dataset. Perform different analysis and visualization using IBM Cognos. After performing the
relevant activities create a document around it and share the same for assessment.
IOT:
In this technology project you will begin building your project by deploying IoT devices and then
developing a Python script on the IoT devices as per the project requirement. After performing the
relevant activities create a document around it and share the same for assessment.
CAD:
In this technology projects you will begin building your project using IBM Cloud Foundry. Perform
different functions as per project requirement. After performing the relevant activities create a
document around it and share the same for assessment.
